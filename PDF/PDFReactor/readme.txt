Upgrading from PDFreactor 7 or earlier
--------------------------------------

If you are upgrading from a PDFreactor integration prior to version 8, you will need to update your integration. The API of PDFreactor 8 and later is not compatible with the API from previous versions. For details about how to migrate from a previous version of PDFreactor, please see our migration guide.

If you are updating an existing copy, be careful if you have customized any files. Be sure to make a backup copy of your previous installation folder. In general you should overwrite all old files with the newer version and then manually reintroduce any changes afterwards.

Important: Since PDFreactor 8 the Web Service requires Java 8 to run. Older Java versions are not supported for the Web Service. The PDFreactor Java Library can still be used with previous Java versions.

The legacy PDFreactor command line binaries are no longer included since PDFreactor 8 and were replaced with a new python based command line interface that uses and requires the PDFreactor Web Service. The legacy PDFreactor command line interface can still be used as before by calling java -jar pdfreactor.jar on the command line. The legacy PDFreactor command line is no longer maintained and some newer features might not be available using it.
