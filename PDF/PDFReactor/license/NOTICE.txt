We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.
We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.

 * with others.
 * 
 * The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 * redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 * fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
 * redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 * names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 * however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 * requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
 * to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 * 
 * DEFINITIONS

 * Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
 * include source files, build scripts and documentation.
 * 
 * "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
 * copyright statement(s).
 * 
 * "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
 * distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
 * 
 * "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,

 * Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
 * new environment.
 * 
 * "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
 * writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
 *

 * redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
 * Software, subject to the following conditions:
 * 
 * 1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
 * in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
 * 
 * 2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
 * redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
 * contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
 * included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
 * in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
 * binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
 * 
 * 3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
 * Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
 * Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as

 * 4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
 * Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
 * Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
 * Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
 * permission.
 * 
 * 5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
 * must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
 * distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
 * remain under this license does not apply to any document created
 * using the Font Software.
 * 
 * TERMINATION
 * This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
